Shark attacks was a mini project that me and 3 other colleagues had to complete during our second week of the  bootcamp. 

The task for the miniproject consisted mainly on cleaning the data provided https://www.sharkattackfile.net/spreadsheets/GSAF5.xls.

In the beginning the main obstacle was the data itself that was very inconsistent, mixed and incorrect at many points. What we decided to do was to define what we wanted to achieve as a business case (sell a device to help people not get attacked by sharks). This helped us to decide what data would actually be useful and what we needed to clean, keep, adapt or delete.

After using several techniques such as .replace, Regex techniques and creating very long functions we managed to clean the data or at least have it in a stage that we considered usable and valid. 

In order to analyse the data we created several tables and charts that would help us prove or disprove our hypotheses that we formulated at the beginning.

Afterwards, as part of the miniproject, we created a presentation in which we shared the step that we took to finish it and the results. The presentation can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OkD-pv_5w8LAEOx471TeW5FvD9qIFn2rhkFj_5kC8Zs/edit?slide=id.g36b0fd11e5f_0_1393#slide=id.g36b0fd11e5f_0_1393
